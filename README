LxTrack
-------

This utility is a NetMgr compatible Netmail Tracker for Linux.
It shouldn´t be much of a problem to port it, though, as I´ve used ANSI
C++ almost exclusively. (strsep() is the only exception)

It reads (or rather should read) the NetMgr config file. At the moment
all keywords there are case-sensitive.

Don´t expect much stability. It has a pretty strong tendency to crash.
And there is no exception-handling at all. (I´m working on it at the moment)

You need an ANSI C++ compiler, which supports strings and vectors. I´m 
using egcs 1.1.

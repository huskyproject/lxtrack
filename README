I. Introduction
===============

Lxtrack was designed to be a fully compatible NetMgr-Clone for Linux. The current
version is somewhere around -0.1 ;) 
Lxtrack do not supported after 2005 year.

II. Config file
===============

Lxtrack uses the same config-format as Netmgr. Refer to Netmgr documentation for
details.

III. Portability Issues
=======================

The code is written almost exclusively using ANSI C++, so it shouldn't be too
hard to port it to any system which has a C++ compiler conforming to ANSI.

III.1 Header Files
==================

If you are using a compiler that has iostream.h instead of iostream defin
 IS_OLDGCC in the Makefile, and it should run.

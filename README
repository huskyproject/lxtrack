I. Introduction
===============

Lxtrack was designed to be a fully compatible NetMgr-Clone for Linux. The current version is somewhere around
-0.1 ;) 


II. Config file
===============

Lxtrack uses the same config-format as Netmgr. Refer to Netmgr documentation for details.

III. Portability Issues
=======================

The code is written almost exclusively using ANSI C++, so it shouldn't be too hard to port it to any system 
which has a C++ compiler conforming to ANSI.
